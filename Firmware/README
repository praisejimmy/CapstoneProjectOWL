This folder contains all firmware to be flashed onto the ESP32 system.

Steps to follow to use firmware:

1. Clone CapstoneProjectOWL github repository
    - Repository is split between Hardware and Firmware projects

2. Download ESP-IDF and add all necessary IDF environment variables to system paths
    - Follow instructions at the following link to set up ESP-IDF

    https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/

3. Navigate to the RAFT directory inside the CapstoneProjectOWL repository using
   the ESP-IDF command prompt

4. Run the command "idf.py build" in the command window and build the project
    - This step will take a while

5. Plug in the DuckLink board and run the "idf.py -p (PORT) flash"
    - Replace (PORT) with the name of the serial port connected to by the DuckLink
      board

6. Device setup is done, run off of USB or battery power
